# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is still in a pre-alpha, proof-of-concept phase. It has not been rigorously analyzed for security. Use of this application in its current state should be considered highly risky.

| Version      | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, you may send the details to familywatchnight+security@gmail.com.

A project maintainer will make reasonable effort -- but with no guarantee -- to respond via email to security vulnerability reports.
Because this early project is changing so rapidly, it may be that the vulnerability you discover will be obsolete due to refactoring already
in progress.

Before this project reaches beta status, a more formal security vulnerability tracking process will be established.
